# **Overview of Network Analysis Using Python and Networkx**
---

<div style="line-height: 1.8;">This notebook will provide the code for generating an example network containing 13 nodes and 17 edges. This network will be used for the purpose of visulaizing how network centrality values can be used to identify or select for specific features of the network structure. The network as shown below is simple. However, once a network centrality is evaluated the nodes of the network can be resized to create a weighted network where the weight is determined by the given centrality.</div> 

## Network Centrality Metrics

<div style="line-height: 1.8;">Network centrality metrics are crucial for quantifying the topology of biological systems, offering profound insights into the roles and significance of various components within these complex networks. These metrics, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality, help identify key nodes that may represent critical proteins, genes, or metabolites in biological pathways. By evaluating the importance and influence of these nodes, researchers can pinpoint potential targets for therapeutic intervention and understand the underlying mechanisms of disease. Degree centrality highlights nodes with numerous direct connections, indicating their potential influence on network stability and function. Betweenness centrality identifies nodes that act as critical connectors or hubs, facilitating communication and interaction within the network. Closeness centrality measures how efficiently information spreads from a node to all other nodes, reflecting its overall accessibility within the network. By leveraging these centrality metrics, scientists can dissect the intricate architecture of biological systems, leading to more targeted and effective approaches in drug discovery, disease diagnosis, and treatment development.</div>div
