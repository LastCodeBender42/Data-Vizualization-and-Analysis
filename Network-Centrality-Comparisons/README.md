Performing scatterplots of different measures of network centrality, such as betweenness and closeness, serves several purposes:

1. **Visualizing Relationships**: Scatterplots allow you to visualize the relationships between different measures of network centrality. By plotting betweenness centrality against closeness centrality (or any other combination), you can see if there is a correlation or pattern between these measures. For example, you might want to investigate if nodes with high betweenness centrality also tend to have high closeness centrality.

2. **Identifying Outliers**: Scatterplots can help you identify outliers or nodes that have unusual centrality values compared to the rest of the network. These outliers could be important nodes in the network that play a unique role in connecting different parts of the network or influencing information flow.

3. **Understanding Network Structure**: Examining scatterplots of centrality measures can provide insights into the underlying structure of the network. For example, if there is a clear pattern in the scatterplot, such as a linear relationship or clustering of points, it could indicate certain structural properties of the network.

4. **Comparing Centrality Measures**: Scatterplots allow you to compare different centrality measures side by side. This can help you understand how different measures capture different aspects of network centrality and which measures are most relevant for your specific network analysis goals.

5. **Diagnostic Tool**: Scatterplots can serve as a diagnostic tool to check the consistency and validity of centrality measures. If there are unexpected patterns or discrepancies in the scatterplot, it may indicate errors in the calculation of centrality measures or underlying issues with the network data.

Overall, scatterplots of different measures of network centrality provide a valuable visual tool for exploring and understanding the centrality properties of complex networks. They can help researchers gain insights into network structure, relationships between nodes, and the overall dynamics of network interactions.
