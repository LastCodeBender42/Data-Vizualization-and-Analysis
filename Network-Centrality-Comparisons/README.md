I have organized these Jupyter Notebooks to be hosted on Binder, a platform that provides cloud-based environments for running code interactively. One thing to note is that when launching a Binder environment, it may take a few minutes for the Docker image to start up and for the environment to become fully accessible.

This startup time is normal and can vary depending on factors such as the size of the environment and the availability of resources. I wanted to mention this in advance to avoid confusion or misunderstanding.

If you have any questions or concerns about this, please feel free to let me know. Looking forward to our discussion!
